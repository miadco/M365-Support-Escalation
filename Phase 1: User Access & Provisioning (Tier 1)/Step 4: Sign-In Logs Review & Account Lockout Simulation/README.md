üîê **Step 4: Sign-In Logs Review & Account Lockout Simulation** ‚Äî `labadmin` Diagnostic Troubleshooting

---

üåü **Objective**
This simulation replicates a realistic Tier 1‚Äì2 escalation scenario involving an account lockout. Using Microsoft Entra ID, we simulate failed login attempts to trigger a lockout and then analyze sign-in logs to identify the root cause. This strengthens core diagnostic and access troubleshooting skills.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Technologies Utilized**

* **Microsoft Entra Admin Center** ‚Äî Interface for identity and access management
* **Sign-In Logs Panel** ‚Äî Detailed tracking of authentication attempts
* **IP & Device Metadata** ‚Äî Contextual information to investigate patterns or risk
* **Error Codes & Diagnostic Layer** ‚Äî Reveal sign-in failures and security flags

‚úÖ **Actions Performed & Key Outcomes**

| **Task**                     | **Outcome / Detail**                                                                                                      | **Rationale / Best Practice Applied**                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual Lockout Triggered     | Repeated incorrect login attempts for `labadmin@micocoopergmail.onmicrosoft.com` resulted in a temporary account lockout. | Simulated a realistic Tier 1 scenario involving credential failure and lockout.         |
| Lockout Screen Verified      | Microsoft login screen confirmed lockout: *"Your account is temporarily locked to prevent unauthorized use."*             | Reproduced user error for visibility and downstream troubleshooting.                    |
| Sign-In Log Accessed         | Navigated to **Users ‚Üí labadmin ‚Üí Sign-in logs** in Entra Admin Center.                                                   | Accessed logs to determine failure timeline and correlate potential risk.               |
| Diagnostic Insights Reviewed | Entra results showed repeated failures and error code **50126** (invalid credentials).                                    | Identified error patterns and user behavior through automated insights.                 |
| Metadata Correlated          | Reviewed IP address, OS, client app, and session ID across failed attempts.                                               | Confirmed logins originated from the correct region and device, eliminating compromise. |

üí† **Key Learnings & Strategic Insights**

* **Tier 1 Relevance**: Account lockouts are one of the most frequent real-world escalations.
* **Context Matters**: IPs, browsers, and OS logs provide crucial context to assess user intent vs. threat.
* **Pattern Recognition**: Error codes like `50126` become repeat indicators‚Äîspeeding up triage.

üß† **Final Thoughts**

There are so many logs auditing tools in Entra. Finding the one that gets you the information that you need is sometimes a challenge for me. This lab gives me more exposure to finding the logs i need and how to interpret the data to make decisions that improve security and administrative posture
