### 👣 Step 2 – Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRA) – Lab Deviation

#### 🔧 Objective
Simulate Tier 2 support diagnostics for OneDrive using Microsoft's official tooling (SaRA or Get Help) to identify root causes of sync issues.

---

#### ⚠️ Real-World Update

As of late 2024, Microsoft has **deprecated the traditional SaRA GUI tool**, with most of its functionality being migrated to the **Windows “Get Help” app** and the **Enterprise SaRA command-line interface**. While this transition aligns with Microsoft's push toward unified troubleshooting experiences, it introduces some friction for lab environments — especially when not using a Windows system.

---

#### 🧪 What Was Attempted

- Attempted to launch and install SaRA in a controlled environment.
- Verified through credible documentation that the GUI version is no longer supported as of **November 2024**.
- Explored the “Get Help” app as a modern alternative, but it is exclusive to **Windows 10/11** systems and unavailable in this Ubuntu-based lab environment.

---

#### 🛠️ Why This Step Couldn't Be Completed

- The lab is being performed on **Ubuntu**, which does not support either SaRA or the Windows “Get Help” diagnostics tool.
- No official Linux-compatible Microsoft diagnostic tool exists for OneDrive at this time.
- Rather than faking the result, this README reflects the **real-world complexity** of platform-dependent tooling and evolving vendor ecosystems.

---

#### 📘 Takeaway

This lab phase highlights an important reality in technical support and IT operations:
> 🧠 **Not every solution fits every environment.** Tools change, systems differ, and platform limitations can impact the diagnostic path.

That’s why adaptability, awareness of tooling shifts, and honest documentation are critical skills in real-world IT.

✅ The lab will continue from **Step 3: SharePoint Access Issue Simulation**, which does not require platform-specific tools.
