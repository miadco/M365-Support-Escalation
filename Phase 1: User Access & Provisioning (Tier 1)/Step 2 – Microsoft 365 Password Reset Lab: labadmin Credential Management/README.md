### üß† Final Thoughts

I‚Äôve completed password resets before using Microsoft Entra ID, but I found the Admin Center interface to be intuitive, efficient, and well-aligned with security best practices.

üëâ Proceed to **Step 3: Configure MFA** to expand on identity hardening and authentication assurance.
