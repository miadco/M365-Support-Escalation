# 📂 Microsoft 365 Support Escalation Lab (Tier 1–2+ Expertise)

## 🧠 Overview

This hands-on lab simulates a day in the life of an IT Support Specialist, providing practical experience in resolving realistic Microsoft 365 issues across Tier 1 and Tier 2+ levels. Each scenario mirrors an actual helpdesk ticket, ranging from basic access issues to advanced PowerShell automation and audit log analysis. My goal in building this project was to solidify and demonstrate comprehensive technical proficiency, a robust troubleshooting workflow, and best practices in documentation.
